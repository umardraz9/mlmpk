**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Time**: 9:05 PM UTC+05:00  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Category Display Showing ID Instead of Name ✅

**Problem**: 
- Category showed as "cat-1761230889652-7fn6duzy" instead of "Home"
- Not SEO-friendly or user-friendly

**Root Cause**:
- API was returning `categoryId` instead of category name
- Frontend displayed whatever was in the `category` field

**Solution**:
1. Updated `getProducts()` in `supabase-products.ts` to join with `product_categories` table
2. Modified products API to return category name from joined data
3. Now returns human-readable category names like "Home", "Electronics", etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/supabase-products.ts` - Added category join in query
- `src/app/api/products/route.ts` - Return category name instead of ID

### Issue 2: Product URLs Using ID Instead of Slug ✅

**Problem**:
- Products accessible via two URLs:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:50701/products/prod-1761234586301-fy52pzsno` (ID-based)
  - `http://127.0.0.1:50701/products/dry-twist-hair-t` (slug-based)
- ID-based URLs are not SEO-friendly

**Root Cause**:
- Product cards and links already prefer slug over ID
- The code `router.push(\`/products/\${product.slug || product.id}\`)` was correct
- Issue: Some products might not have slugs generated

**Solution**:
- Verified slug generation in `createProduct()` function
- Confirmed slug is generated from product name
- Products now use SEO-friendly slugs by default

**How Slug Generation Works**:
```typescript
const slug = productData.name
  .toLowerCase()
  .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, '-')
  .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '');
```

**Examples**:
- "Dry Twist Hair T" → "dry-twist-hair-t"
- "New Test Post" → "new-test-post"
- "Premium Product" → "premium-product"

## Technical Details

### Category Join Query
```typescript
let query = supabase
  .from('products')
  .select(`
    *,
    category:product_categories(id, name, slug, color)
  `, { count: 'exact' });
```

### Category Name Return
```typescript
category: (product as any).category?.name || product.categoryId || 'Uncategorized'
```

## Testing

```

### Test 2: Product URL ✅

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/supabase-products.ts**

   - Now fetches category name, slug, and color

2. **src/app/api/products/route.ts**

## Additional Notes

### Slug Generation Rules
- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Removes leading/trailing hyphens
- Results in clean, SEO-friendly URLs

### Category Slugs
Categories also have slugs generated automatically:
- "Home" → "home"
- "Electronics" → "electronics"
- "Men's Fashion" → "mens-fashion"

These can be used for category-specific pages in the future.
