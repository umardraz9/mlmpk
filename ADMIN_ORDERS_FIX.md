# Admin Orders Page - Fixed! ✅

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Time**: 11:08 PM UTC+05:00  
**Issue**: Orders not showing in admin panel  
**Status**: FIXED ✅

---

## Problem Identified

The admin orders page was using **Prisma (old SQLite database)** instead of **Supabase**. That's why:
- ❌ New orders not showing
- ❌ Admin dashboard showing error
- ❌ React hooks error

---

## Solution Applied

### File Changed
`src/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts`

### What Was Fixed

1. **Removed Prisma imports** - Old database connection
2. **Added Supabase imports** - New cloud database
3. **Updated authentication** - Using custom session instead of NextAuth
4. **Rewrote order fetching** - Now queries Supabase directly
5. **Fixed analytics** - Calculates from real Supabase data

### Before (Old - Prisma/SQLite)
```typescript
import { db as prisma } from '@/lib/db'
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'

const orders = await prisma.order.findMany({...})
```

### After (New - Supabase)
```typescript
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase'
import { getSession } from '@/lib/session'

const { data: orders } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*, order_items(...)')
```

---

## What Now Works

✅ **Admin can see all orders**
- Shows orders from Supabase
- Real-time updates
- Proper pagination

✅ **Order details visible**
- Order number
- Customer email
- Total amount
- Payment status
- Shipping address

✅ **Search and filters**
- Search by order number
- Filter by status
- Filter by payment status

✅ **Analytics working**
- Total orders count
- Pending orders
- Completed orders
- Revenue calculations

- ✅ Consistent hook calls
