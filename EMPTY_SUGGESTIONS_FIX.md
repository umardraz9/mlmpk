# Empty Friend Suggestions - Fixed

## ❌ Why It Was Empty

### Root Cause
The API was **only looking for users who created REELS** (video posts with `type='reel'`), but your database only has regular text posts. No reels = No suggestions!

### Previous Logic (Broken)
```typescript
// ❌ Only searches for reel creators
const reelCreators = await prisma.post.findMany({
  where: {
    type: 'reel',           // ❌ Only reel posts
    videoUrl: { not: null }  // ❌ Must have video
  }
});
```

**Result**: Empty array because no reels exist → Empty suggestions!

---

## ✅ The Fix

### New Logic (Works!)
```typescript
// ✅ Shows ALL active users with posts
const activeUsers = await prisma.socialPost.findMany({
  where: {
    status: 'ACTIVE',  // ✅ Any active post
    // Excludes current user
  },
  include: {
    author: { ... }  // ✅ Gets user details
  }
});
```

### Fallback Strategy
If no users have posts, shows **any active users**:
```typescript
if (users.length === 0) {
  finalUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
    where: {
      isActive: true  // ✅ Any active user
    }
  });
}
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Suggestions API** (`/api/social/suggestions/route.ts`)

**Before:**
- ❌ Only searched for reel creators
- ❌ Required `type='reel'` AND `videoUrl` not null
- ❌ Would return empty if no reels exist

**After:**
- ✅ Searches for ALL active users with posts
- ✅ Falls back to any active users if no posts
- ✅ Always returns users (never empty)

### 2. **Updated Reels API** (`/api/social/reels/route.ts`)

**Before:**
- ❌ Only searched for `type='reel'`
- ❌ Used wrong Prisma client (`prisma.post` instead of `prisma.socialPost`)

**After:**
- ✅ Searches for posts with videos OR type='reel'
- ✅ Uses correct Prisma model (`socialPost`)
- ✅ Works with existing database structure

### 3. **Fixed Prisma Client Issues**
- Changed from `import prisma from '@/lib/prisma'` 
- To `import { db as prisma } from '@/lib/db'`
- Uses correct model names (`socialPost`, not `post`)

## ✨ Summary

**Problem**: Suggestions were empty because API only looked for reel creators, but no reels existed in database.

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ Broader search criteria (any posts, not just reels)

3. ✅ Fixed Prisma imports and models
4. ✅ Proper error handling

**The "People You May Know" section now displays real users!** 🚀
