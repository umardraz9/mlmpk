# Blog Page Fixes - Dark Mode & Post Routing

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Dark Mode Text Visibility** ✅
**Problem:** Text was not visible in dark mode - gray text on dark background made content unreadable.

**Solution:** Added comprehensive dark mode support with proper text color contrast:
- Imported `useTheme` hook from `@/contexts/ThemeContext`
- Updated background: `bg-gray-900` in dark mode
- Updated all text colors with conditional classes:
  - Headings: `text-white` (dark) / `text-gray-900` (light)
  - Body text: `text-gray-300` (dark) / `text-gray-700` (light)
  - Secondary text: `text-gray-400` (dark) / `text-gray-600` (light)
- Updated all Card components with dark backgrounds: `bg-gray-800 border-gray-700`
- Updated input fields with dark styling: `bg-gray-700 border-gray-600 text-white`
- Updated buttons with proper dark mode states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/blog/page.tsx` - Added dark mode support throughout

### 2. **Blog Post Routing Error** ✅
**Problem:** Clicking on blog posts showed "Post Not Found" error. The URL was correct (`/blog/15-tested-ways-to-earn-money-in-pakistan`) but the API endpoint didn't exist.

**Root Cause:** 
- Frontend was fetching posts by slug: `/api/blog/posts/${slug}`
- API only had `/api/blog/posts/[id]` endpoint (by ID, not slug)
- No slug-based endpoint existed

**Solution:** Created new API endpoint for fetching posts by slug:

**New File Created:**
- `src/app/api/blog/posts/[slug]/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Fetches blog post by slug from database
- Increments view count automatically
- Transforms data to match frontend interface
- Returns 404 if post not found
- Includes all necessary relations (category, author, tags)
- Calculates read time based on content length
- Provides fallback images and data
