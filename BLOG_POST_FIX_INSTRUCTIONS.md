# Blog Post "Not Found" Fix

## Problem
Blog posts show "Post Not Found" error when clicked because the API route wasn't loaded by the server.

## Solution
The API endpoint has been created at `src/app/api/blog/posts/[slug]/route.ts` and the blog posts exist in the database. You just need to **restart the development server** to load the new route.

## Steps to Fix:

### 1. Stop the Current Server
Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the dev server is running (port 3002)

### 2. Restart the Server
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3002
```

### 3. Test the Blog Posts
After the server restarts, visit these URLs - they should all work:
- http://localhost:3002/blog/15-tested-ways-to-earn-money-in-pakistan
- http://localhost:3002/blog/starting-online-business-pakistan
- http://localhost:3002/blog/digital-marketing-strategies-pakistan
- http://localhost:3002/blog/technology-trends-pakistan-2024

## What Was Fixed:

### 1. Created API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/blog/posts/[slug]/route.ts`
- Fetches blog posts by slug (not ID)
- Returns transformed data matching frontend interface
- Automatically increments view count
- Handles errors gracefully with proper 404 responses

### 2. Blog Posts in Database
All 4 blog posts already exist in the database with the correct slugs:
- ✅ 15-tested-ways-to-earn-money-in-pakistan
- ✅ starting-online-business-pakistan
- ✅ digital-marketing-strategies-pakistan
- ✅ technology-trends-pakistan-2024

### 3. Dark Mode Support
The blog page now has full dark mode support with proper text contrast.

## Why Restart is Needed

Next.js caches routes at startup. When you create a new API route file, the server doesn't automatically detect it. Restarting the server forces Next.js to:
1. Re-scan the `app` directory
2. Register all API routes
3. Build the new route handlers

## Verification

After restarting, you can verify the API works by visiting:
```
http://localhost:3002/api/blog/posts/15-tested-ways-to-earn-money-in-pakistan
```

You should see JSON data for the blog post instead of a 404 error.

## Alternative: Use Port 3000

If you prefer to use port 3000 (the default), simply run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then access the blog at:
- http://localhost:3000/blog
