# Social Feed Final Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Notifications Page Created**
- ✅ **Created**: `/social/notifications` page
- ✅ **Features**:
  - Shows all user notifications (likes, comments, shares, friend requests)
  - Displays unread count at the top
  - "Mark all as read" button
  - Click on notification to mark as read and navigate to the related post
  - Beautiful UI with icons and time ago display
  - Empty state when no notifications
  - Back to feed link
- **File**: `src/app/social/notifications/page.tsx`
- **Result**: No more 404 error when clicking notification icon

### 2. **Friend Suggestions & Reels - Now Alternating in Feed**
- ✅ **Created**: Separate components for better organization
  - `FriendSuggestions.tsx` - Shows people you may know
  - `ReelsSuggestions.tsx` - Shows trending reels
- ✅ **Pattern**: Alternates every 5 posts
  - After **5 posts** → **Friend Suggestions** appear
  - After **10 posts** → **Reels Suggestions** appear
  - After **15 posts** → **Friend Suggestions** appear again
  - After **20 posts** → **Reels Suggestions** appear again
  - Pattern continues...
- ✅ **Logic**: Uses modulo math to alternate
  ```typescript
  const insertionNumber = Math.floor((i + 1) / 5);
  const isEven = insertionNumber % 2 === 0;
  // isEven ? ReelsSuggestions : FriendSuggestions
  ```
- **Result**: Both sections now visible and alternating in feed
