# Follow & Friend Request Schema Fix

## ‚ùå The Problem

**Error**: "Failed to toggle follow" when clicking Follow or Add Friend buttons

**Root Cause**: Prisma schema had **ambiguous relations** error. The `FriendRequest` and `Friendship` models had multiple relations to the `User` model without unique names.

---

## ‚úÖ The Fix

### 1. Updated Prisma Schema

**Before (Broken):**
```prisma
model FriendRequest {
  sender    User @relation(fields: [senderId], references: [id])
  recipient User @relation(fields: [recipientId], references: [id])
  // ‚ùå Ambiguous - both point to User without relation names
}

model Friendship {
  user1 User @relation(fields: [user1Id], references: [id])
  user2 User @relation(fields: [user2Id], references: [id])
  // ‚ùå Ambiguous - both point to User without relation names
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```prisma
model FriendRequest {
  sender    User @relation("SentFriendRequests", fields: [senderId], references: [id])
  recipient User @relation("ReceivedFriendRequests", fields: [recipientId], references: [id])
  // ‚úÖ Unique relation names
}

model Friendship {
  user1 User @relation("FriendshipsAsUser1", fields: [user1Id], references: [id])
  user2 User @relation("FriendshipsAsUser2", fields: [user2Id], references: [id])
  // ‚úÖ Unique relation names
}
```

### 2. Updated User Model

Added the relation fields:
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Friend Request Relations
  sentFriendRequests      FriendRequest[]  @relation("SentFriendRequests")
  receivedFriendRequests  FriendRequest[]  @relation("ReceivedFriendRequests")
  
  // Friendship Relations
  friendshipsAsUser1      Friendship[]     @relation("FriendshipsAsUser1")
  friendshipsAsUser2      Friendship[]     @relation("FriendshipsAsUser2")
}
```
