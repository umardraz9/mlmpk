**Manual Review Process:**
- Task assignment to reviewers based on category expertise
- Review queue prioritization based on task value and user history
- Consensus-based review for high-value tasks
- Appeal process for disputed decisions
- Review performance tracking and feedback

### **Task System Security Measures**

#### **Data Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive task submission data
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- User data anonymization in analytics
- GDPR compliance for European users
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

#### **Fraud Prevention**
- IP-based submission tracking
- Device fingerprinting for user verification
